### 2.6 Running Grunt

Assuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed follow the instructions on the [Grunt website] (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#working-with-an-existing-grunt-project).

#### 2.6.1 Available Grunt Tasks 

There are several Grunt tasks available to developers. View the Gruntfile.js for a listing of included tasks

* ```grunt``` will run a predefined set of tasks and result in an ongoing 'watch' tasks which responds to any changes to JavaScript and SASS files by compiling, concatenating and minifying the output.
* ```grunt qunit``` will run all QUnit tests

Note: it is important to run Grunt before checking in code to ensure all JavaScript tests are passing. 

### 2.7 Composer dependency management

Composer is used for dependency management, initially for PHPUnit but extending to other dependencies as needed. 

#### 2.7.1 Installing Composer

To install Composer, from within the ```tna-base``` directory open the Terminal and execute this command: 

```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php```

This downloads the Composer installer script with ```curl``` and executes it with PHP, resulting in a ```composer.phar``` file (the Composer binary) being placed in the current working directory. 

Having done this follow these steps:

* Type ```sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer``` into the Terminal
* Append this line to your ```~/.bash_profile``` file ```PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH```

At this stage you should be able to execute the ```composer``` command in the Terminal to see all the available options.

#### 2.7.2 Obtaining dependencies via Composer

Having followed the steps above you will be able to install dependencies by typing ```composer install``` at the Terminal.

### 2.8 PHPUnit

Having followed the steps under 'Installing Composer' type ```vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml``` from within the ```tna-base``` directory to run Unit Tests for the project.

Note: PhpStorm allows for PHPUnit integration - allowing your tests to be run automatically. Search the JetBrains website to find out how to configure this.

### 2.9 QUnit

Any JavaScript written for this theme should be unit tested with QUnit. See the ```js/tests/example``` directory for an example QUnit test and fixture.
